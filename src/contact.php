            My fascination with line, color and shape began in childhood. I loved the silhouettes
            that the kindergarten teacher drew with the opaque projector, and the hand prints in plaster,
            painted gold.

            My mother, who was an excellent seamstress, would take great pains to match the colors of
            fabric, trim and thread, or the patterns of a plaid on a garment she was making.
            Her "Hmm, how should I do that?" attitude was a major influence. One of my early memories of
            making art was sewing a gift bag to wrap a book for a birthday present. Later, I made
            doll furniture for myself and to sell to my friends. When asked my favorite thing to do,
            the answer was always, "Making things."

            However, as time went on, this part of me became like my china: locked in a cabinet, visible
            and definitely there, but awaiting release. Then one day, upon retrieving my daughter from a
            clay class that she was taking, it struck me, "That's what I want to do!". Many classes later...

            I like to celebrate the ordinary. It is easy to find inspiration in everyday life. My work may
            begin at my bedside, on a walk, or in the car - wherever I am when an idea comes. Then, at the studio,
            with my written thought or sketch in hand, I determine the tools and ingredients I will need to begin
            the actual construction process. A myriad of choices and opportunities are mine. Sometimes the vision
            changes in the process.

            I want my work to be colorful and have pleasing proportions. Sometimes elegance is desirable. Goofy
            and humorous are good, because I like things that make me laugh. I like contrast, appreciate irony, and
            find the juxtaposition of many things fascinating. An occasional nod to the cozy,
            familiar and comfortable suits me well.
